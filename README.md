# CSE539-Certificate-Authentication
Digital certificates are electronic documents that are used to identify an individual, company, server, or other entity while associating the identity with a public key. You could think of a digital certificate like that of a passport, driverâ€™s license, or personal ID which provides a recognized proof of identity. Digital certificates can be essential to security. The implementation of digital certifications assists in the problem of impersonation as it is privacy-based which will allow the private data to be protected and prevents those without access from viewing. The purpose of this project is to challenge students to write a program that interacts with given certificates.
